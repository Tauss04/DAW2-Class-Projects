-BARBERSHOP: 
In this class project, we were asked to create a website for managing appointments at a barbershop. In this system, clients could schedule appointments with their preferred barber, and barbers could view all their appointments and request available time slots.
In the project, we have a file called "barberia.sql," which is used to import the database that the PHP program works with.
The first user must register, and once registered, they can access the program. To log in as a barber, you should use the following credentials - User: oscar - Password: oscar (the same for omar and kevin).
