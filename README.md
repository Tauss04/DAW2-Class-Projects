-BARBERSHOP: 
In this class project, we were asked to create a website for managing appointments at a barbershop. In this system, clients could schedule appointments with their preferred barber, and barbers could view all their appointments and request available time slots.
In the project, we have a file called "barberia.sql," which is used to import the database that the PHP program works with.
The first user must register, and once registered, they can access the program. To log in as a barber, you should use the following credentials - User: oscar - Password: oscar (the same for omar and kevin).

-SECONDHAND STORE:
In this class project, the teacher asked us to develop a secondhand online store with Codeigniter4 where users could see all the items for sale on the page, filter and search for items, and of course, communicate directly with the seller through a chat. As a seller, you could upload your items, modify them, chat with buyers, and set the status of the item as sold or available for sale. The CSS part isn't finished. Who enjoys CSS? :)

Before starting the program, you must:
  1.Import the database mercadillogitanillo.sql into your server.
  2.Change the path of the .env file to your PC's IP address.
  3.Change the path of /styles/font.css to your PC's IP address.
  4.Change the path of /Home.php line 149 to the path where you host /htdocs on your PC.
  5.Now you can enjoy mercadilloGitanillo. Thank you for using the program :)
